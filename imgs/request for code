Hi Boris,
    I am a first-year master's student, taking the liberty to add a file to your project, because I just started using the github platform,
so I don't know how to use it, and I am currently studying the topic of sequence prediction, which is more urgent.So first think about
trying to reach you, and then go deeper into this superb platform. I am interested in GAN and RL. Would you like to share the code for me? 
I wish you a happy life!

Thanks !
