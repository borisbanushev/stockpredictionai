Halo Boris,

Firstly, thank you for sharing your knowledge with us. I am a college student majoring in data science I am very interested in your project. 
Hence, I really want to learn it throughly and apply it to other tasks in my academics. However, I am still a little confused about some details, including how to construct the GAN and connect all the project to predict and optimize.
Therefore, if possible, I would like to get a better look at your code. Could you please send the code to the following email address: 3210105936@zju.edu.cn.

Thank you very much!!!

Best wishes,
Anchor.
