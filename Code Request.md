Hi Boris,

I'm actually on the way of finding approaches applicable to forex trading and I found your's really interesting.
Such a great effort, specially the data preparation part and the way autoencoders were used.

And at the end I would gratefully ask you to share your code and dataset.

Sincerely,
Hossein
