Hi Boris,

I recently came across your article on combining multiple types of neural networks to predict time series data.
This is an area I am interested in learning more about, I would like to see your code to get an idea on how to build something similar for other time series data, I would also like to try and tweak it for the keras library instead of mxnet.

Best Regards.
